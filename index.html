    <p>
      We specialize in helping people grow food in any available space- big or small. We use permaculture principles and
      past island experience to create beautiful gardens that will thrive in this unique environment that Big Island
      offers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our mission is to help you establish food security that will need less outside resources over time (such as mulch
      and fertilizer). We can build raised bed gardens and herb spirals, create food bearing hedgerows for privacy, help
      with incorporating animals into the system, or simply offer guidance as you move forward with raw land or DIY
      projects!
    </p>
    <h2>Tree Care</h2>
    <p>
      If you already have fruit trees established, we offer tree pruning and can help deal with pests and disease, as
      well as long term tree care and maintenance.
    </p>
    <h2>Consultations</h2>
    <p>
      If you have raw land, we offer scouting and consultations on how to work with the landscape. We can help make a
      plan regarding where to put building and garden pads, identify possible flood conditions or areas suitable for
      ponds, and trees to keep. We can help you take advatage of the machinery on site to utilize tree waste, such as
      creating privacy and food producing burms- rather than paying thousands to get it hauled away.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you live on a drier part of the island, we can help you create an oasis that will eventually require little
      water, and will help protect you from wildfires.

      Together, we are a team greater than the separate sum of our parts. We are both from the Midwest, and were raised
      working part time on our family's farms. We have worked on many farms in Hawaii, and have learned a lot from our
      elders here. However, we've learned the most from starting our own food forest! We take pride in our work ethic,
      reliability, and our ability to help you envision and create your own paradise.

    <h1 class="mb-2">Work With Us</h1>
    <p>
      When hired, after an initial consultation, we will work with you to create a planting guide, and advise on the
      steps needed to move forward (black cinder/soil/mulch delivery, flood management, mulch crops and etc). Big Island
      is a unique planting/growing environment that, unfortunately, mainland (and even other islands') planting/growing
      customs don't apply to.
    </p>
    <p>
      We charge $70/hr for consultations, but dont charge if it goes over an hour for 1 acre lots or smaller. 3+ acre
      lots that are fully cleared can take closer to 2 hours. Our hourly rate is $70/hr total which includes full access
      to our tools, and trailer if needed. $80/hr + gas outside the Puna/Hilo/Volcano area.

      *Depending on the job, only one of us may be required, in which case the rate is $35/Puna, and $40 + gas/outside
      of Puna.

      **Only planting guide or consultation work is available as well. Quotes for guide will depend on amount of area
      the map is for and is offered after the consultation.
