      Food Forest Folks specializes in helping people grow food in any available space, big or small. We use
      permaculture principles and past island experience to create beautiful gardens that will thrive in this unique
      environment that Big Island offers. Our mission is to help you establish food security that will need less outside
      resources over time (such as mulch and fertilizer).

        <h2 class="text-center mb-4">Tree Care</h2>
        <p>
          We offer tree pruning and care for established fruit trees. We can help mitigate pests and disease, as well as
          teach or provide long-term tree care and maintenance. We can also help you plan for and plant new orchards.

        <h2 class="text-center mb-4">Raised Beds</h2>
        <p>
          Rased beds and gardens are crucial for growing food on Big Island. We can build any sized raised bed or herb
          spiral, using as many resources on hand as possible.

        <h2 class="text-center mb-4">Real Estate Scouting</h2>
        <p>
          We can evaluate whether an area is good for growing food, identify possible flood conditions or areas suitable
          for ponds, and trees to keep. We can use our drone for aerial photos, as well as knowledge and experience of
          the island (and its weather), to offer guidance as you consider what property to buy.

        <h2 class="text-center mb-4">Consultation</h2>
        <p>
          Do you have an area that you've wanted to transform but need some ideas? Are you new to the island and need to
          learn how to work with a new environment, or just want to learn what's growing in your backyard? Want to get a
          school gardening program together but need some advice on the specifics for growing crops? We work with
          private and public clients to offer guidance on how to make your idea into reality. We use our consultations
          as personal classes to teach you anything and everything you want to know to grow your own food successfully.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can also help during the construction process to take advantage of the machinery on site to utilize tree
          waste, such as creating privacy and food producing burms- rather than paying thousands to get it hauled away.

        <h2 class="text-center mb-4">Design</h2>
        <p>
          We can help you plan out your food forest to utilize your landscape as efficiently and easily as possible. We
          can also help you create food bearing hedgerows and trellises to provide privacy from your neighbors.
          Designing can be as informal as verbally brainstorming with the client, or as professional as a digital design
          overlaying a drone photo of your property.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our goal is to help you plan out a beautiful, self-sustaining, food producing paradise that is easy to manage
          and has its own mulch and fertilizer crops.

            plan regarding where to put building and garden pads, identify possible flood conditions or areas suitable
